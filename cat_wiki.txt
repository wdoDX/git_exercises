Cat Genetics
============================

The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid
organisms that possess 38 chromosomes[43] and roughly 20,000 genes.[44]
About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many
similar to human inborn errors.[45] The high level of similarity among
the metabolisms of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be
diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in
humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the
human diseases

Anatomy
============================

Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis,
typically weighing between 4–5 kg (8.8–11 lb).[30] However, some breeds, such
as the Maine Coon, can occasionally exceed 11 kg (25 lb). Conversely, very
small cats (less than 1.8 kg (4.0 lb)) have been reported.[48] The world
record for the largest cat is 21.3 kg (47 lb).[49] The smallest adult cat
ever officially recorded weighed around 1.36 kg (3.0 lb).[49] Feral cats tend
to be lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats. In
the Boston area, the average feral adult male will scale 3.9 kg (8.6 lb) and
average feral female 3.3 kg (7.3 lb).[50] Cats average about 23–25 cm (9–10
in) in height and 46 cm (18.1 in) in head/body length (males being larger than
females), with tails averaging 30 cm (11.8 in) in length
