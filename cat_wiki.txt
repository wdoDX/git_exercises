Cat Genetics

The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid
organisms that possess 38 chromosomes[43] and roughly 20,000 genes.[44]
About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many
similar to human inborn errors.[45] The high level of similarity among
the metabolisms of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be
diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in
humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the
human diseases
